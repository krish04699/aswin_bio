        <p>HI, Before Iam Going To share my things, I Would Like to say a big thanks to you for your curiousness to know about me.
            As you know that my name is ASWINRAAJ I am currently pursuing my final year computer science engineering in DR. MAHALINGAM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY.
            on October 13 one of the unforgettable days in my life, the day which I stepped to a new responsible person, yes on that day I got selected in an IT company which was NTT DATA.
            <br>
            I believe that life is based on the situation. Because my life experience is the best example for that, on 5th my ambition is to became a software engineer because that time is "Yaradi ne Mohini “film was my favourite 10th my ambition is to became a doctor because i scored 99 in science. On 12th my ambition is to get a pass mark by luckily, I passed but I scored low marks.
            for my mark, no college will offer a seat for a computer science group.by some people influence I had joined in this college on this group. Fees was too high, what to do, at least for paying I should get placed on campus that’s why I put a small effort so, this made me to realise that life is fully based on situation.
